        <h2>Design is how it works</h2>
        <p>
          I think of design more-so as <em>how it works</em>, rather than the surface aesthetics (visual/feel/auditory)
          that would normally first come to mind. The aesthetics are certainly a factor, but not the only, and certainly
          not the most important (in my opinion).
        </p>
        <p>
          My sense of design is tactical, practical, and focused on the purpose. And the purpose is achieving whatever
          end goal the user has; therefore, it should start with the user. Then, we can get creative in all the avenues
          to design for that goal in a way that it works. Sometimes that means getting creative in how how we engineer
          parts of the solution because of technical constraints.
        </p>

          Like how I built a never-before-done (I checked!) dual-API approach to combine static GTFS stations data with
          dynamic stop API Data to allows Chicago transit riders to select for <em>direction</em> specific train routes
          because that's <em>what makes sense</em>.

          So here's some more examples of things I built that are designed (i.e. work) for the purpose they serve
        </h2>

          For the Garpple running app, the magic moment is when runners see their health data on their phone in a way they've never seen
          before â€” so we do that in their first two clicks.

          When I couldn't deliver hand written notes to colleagues as a way to thank them for their impact, the next
          best thing to make it "real" was a 3D experience where they could digitally touch and open the letter
          themselves.

          An app that sparks conversations about yourself on a social platform should be easy to share.

          Answering an ambiguous question ("Which Divvy bike station in Chicago needs another rack?") should have an
          experiment designed such that there can be a recommendation.
