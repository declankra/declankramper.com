**tldr;** wanted to write more but there wasn't enough pain if I didn't, so I started a writing challenge with a friend and we forfeit $ to each other if we don't

There's plenty of thoughts I come back to often, thoughts I'd love to explore deeper and share to the vast expanse that is the internet. Putting stuff out there on the internet is intriguing because you never know who may find out, and most of the times, you probably never know who actually does find it. Its fun in that sense. Brimming with potential serendipity and connections, but for most of the time you spend there, a lonely place. Now I can't say there is a singular reason I do choose to put “stuff” out there, but I will say the potential of it helping out in my career is certainly top of mind. The introverts way to networking (not that I'm solely an introvert, a topic for another discussion). What I do know for sure is - through my own experience in Mr. Bronke's 9th grade class where we did weekly "speed dumps" of nonstop continuous writing for 10 minutes at the beginning of class and *actually* personal writing assignments or in Mrs. Doose's 7th grade exploration into language, writing, and presentation as an art and journey of self-exploration or for my natural desire to start through countless, half used notebooks to write about "my thoughts" and daydream about writing a book[^1] or through all the podcasts where people in positions I desire speak to the power of writing as a sneakily inevitable way to advance their careers and self-understanding - writing works. It forces you to think. To mull over each word, each sentence, and each paragraph to convey what you mean. That's hard. And self-administered hard things bode well in the longterm (we all know that). So, why don't I write more?

Blah blah blah, executive function[^2], blah blah. Nah, I think it's much simpler and honest than that: I don't feel pain if I don't write. There's not *enough* pain. There's no consequence. There's not *enough* consequence. Here, the word enough is important. And its also not enough to explain the complexity of the concept I'll try to tackle in this post; the opposite of pain, pleasure (conventionally speaking that is, something that we'll also wrangle), is also important in the equation of answering the question:

**Why do we do the things that we do?**

So now we have arrived at the key Q2A for this post (Q2A = Question(s) to Answer). I like framing problems in terms of questions, because asking the right question - which is very hard to do - is paradoxically really clarifying [^3]).

Do we do things that we do because we want to do them? Do we want to do things to avoid what happens if we don't? Do we even do things we only just *want* to do - or must we *have* to do them?

Why do we not finish a piece of writing that we feel comfortable putting out there? Why are we now just being forced to put up this unfinished piece of writing because we didn’t get to finishing it or the two pieces?

Hmmm.

Well it’s not coming down, so i best revise it. 

Because there’s still some thoughts i want to share:

- If I do my best work at the last minute, own that. Do last minute work. But the key is that you must still have tight deadlines or else too much time is wasted on non important work. Give yourself enough time to explore, with enough tightness to reel it back in and deliver Y. → links to adhd post.
- evolutionary. There's no incentive to do so.
- hot surface, move hand
- challenge to write more - losing money is painful
- what i talk about when i talk about running - pain making us feel alive, reminding us that we are alive
- why do we do things?
- for enjoyment? or to avoid pain? or do we enjoy pain itself?
- incentives
- corporate careers - things aren't painful so why change? in anything. life is becoming more comfortable for most of the planet, prosperity is increasing [ link to source ]
- what is the opposite of pain - is it pleasure/enjoyment? or something else?
