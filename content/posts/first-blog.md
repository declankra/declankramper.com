thought this was a good first question to answer for my first write up. not all posts will be about answering questions. but i do think questions, specifically the *right* questions (which is a whole other topic, hard to do), are a good place to start.

first, back story on how this blog took too long to happen; i was overcomplicating it. i can tell now when i am overcomplicating things (although it may take a couple days or weeks (2 in this case) to tell) because i lose interest in them and it makes my head go blank almost. its a feeling of like nothing because i lost connection with what i was really trying to pursue in the first place.

i wanted to write a blog to work with my thoughts, think deeper, and have an outlet to get them out of my head. plus, it'd be cool to look back on these in 1,5,10+ years from now. but the action of writing this blog got clouded because there's, of course, a million ways to do that. lets just say i considered a lot of options and told myself i had to do something else first before i actually did this blog (like the deferred life plan, but i do it for all the little things in life - which sums to the whole??). this has been a common theme which was relabeled as a problem when doing the EOY reflections and thought it prevented me from actually DOING. actually finishing. actually having something tangible to stand behind. actually having something to publish, like this blog post.

so, cheers to this blog post. a first of many. cheers to doing. cheers to the weekend.

post thoughts:

- just did a quick re-read to make sure the question was answered; yeah. speaks for itself.
- will this be a weekly Friday thing? ad-hoc? there's just no cool word that starts with F for Friday. like Thursday thoughts works but not Friday. oh well.
- next week's post will actually be a more put together ~thought~ because i actually have some thoughts I've been wanting to think deeper about and expand on
