How are you different now than you were three years ago?

I was recently asked this question and drew a blank. Like, a hard blank. Think, Declan, think. Yes, this was a high pressure situation and my answer was going to be analyzed to determine whether it was a good answer and also enough of a “right” answer. Although there is no singular right answer, or any truly wrong answers, there’s certainly answers that wouldn’t *fit*. Since I hadn’t asked myself this question before, I tried to piece one together that fit. (spoiler: it didn’t land) [^1]

It bothered me that I didn’t have a crystal clear answer. I sunk deeper into my chair. It bothered me after the conversation ended and, even while walking outside with fresh air, I was still devoid of an answer. It was a bit of an ego hit because I’ve always considered myself a deep thinker and a reflective person. Is this no longer the case? How? Is my mindless job degrading my ability to do so? Has the infinity pool doom scrolling finally caught up? Is it something to do with pharmacology? Could it be that I’ve been eating in a surplus this week and therefore devoting to much energy to digestion? What if I was standing and could move slightly, would the answer have came to me then? Was I just too anxious because of the person on the other end of the answer? Is my brain fried?

Perhaps, its much simpler: I never *truly* thought about it before. [^2]

What?! I think *alllllll* the time. I think and think and unfortunately I overthink, too. I think so much that I tell myself I need to think less and do more. I certainly think about myself. I think about who I am, who I could be, and what I should’ve done. So, how do I *not* know what has changed in the past three years if so much of what I do is think?

Because I’m not finishing my thoughts. I’m thinking a lot of them (over a thousand notes in my apple notes!) but I’m not putting in the effort to truly understand what they mean. I think I might just be doom scrolling my own internal feed of short-form thoughts, not stopping to turn any one into a cinematic masterpiece meant for the big screen.[^3]

So now I’m wondering what’s the true cause to me drawing a blank to that question: Have I never thought of that particular question before or am I not finishing any of my thoughts? The former is a question of personal reflection, but I’m not quite sure the latter — is it laziness? carelessness? inability to focus?

Accepting the simple explanation would be a dismissal of all the other possible explanations for why this might be - phrased another way, it’d be a dismissal of all the excuses. Although not  Occam’s original interpretation, his razor cuts through the comforting reasoning in this case to reveal that what I might actually just need is focused effort.

Let’s consider the opposite. Let’s say I was finishing my thoughts. What would I be doing? I’d be talking clearly and with purpose. I’d be calling upon not just past thoughts, but past learnings. There’d be less “that’s crazy” and more “so whats”. I would be assertive; giving assertions and taking ownership for my ideas and thoughts because I’ve considered why it would succeed or what risks and challenges would occur if it didn’t. It’d be a vote of confidence in myself.

Did you know that rumination is not the same thing as reflection? I didn’t quite know what rumination was either, but now I have a better understanding of both. Is it laziness, carelessness, inability to focus, lack of intelligence or something else entirely that causes me to not remember “everyday” words or their meanings? Sometimes I draw blank on words during conversation. Words are hard, I say. I don’t want them to be hard forever. Rumination is a state of circling on the same thought without progress. It’s like running in circles, legs fueled with anxiety, trying to go further by speeding up. When one is ruminating, they’re reinforcing anxieties and falling victim to criticism as an imposter of analysis. Reflection, on the other hand, pulls you out of that loop. When you reflect, you find the patterns in your laps and turn them into something coherent you can apply elsewhere. Therefore, they take you elsewhere. The thoughts become *useful*. They take on *meaning*.

If I finished my thoughts, the self-critiquing ruminations would become reflections. 

My thoughts are fleeting. I’ve got a fairly strong inner dialogue. Except when I don’t. Now that may sound dishonest — people speak in in generics when describing themselves as who they want to be, not who they actually are — but it’s more truth than fiction [^4]. This past Friday my thoughts were silent, lonely, and reminiscent of someone with no light in their eyes while the Friday before they look like an episode of Tom & Jerry. That sounds quite dramatic, but I think the swings are as such. Would I have it any other way? I’m not sure because if it that wasn’t the case then it would be somewhere in the middle and I’d never get to experience the serendipitous exploration of the period when it’s cranked to the fullest. I must find a way to finish those thoughts.

And now this is such an ironic stopping point because I’ve got 2400 words I’ve written that I’m losing focus on the purpose of this post: meaning-making. So I will use that focus and continue tomorrow.

[^1]: it obviously didn’t land because it lacked the personal-ness and clarity that comes from having reflected on such a question before. the answer was along the lines of how i’m more confident that ‘product’ is the right career path for me because i’ve been doing ‘product’ my whole life in how i approached problem solving with the end goal (customer and business) in mind. true, but weak. ironically, if i had fully-fleshed this idea out more, it could’ve been a good answer *and* a good fit.
[^2]: i like that metaphor. It’s symbolic of the trend in our society, too. Maybe there’s an english word to describe that use of a metaphor. 
[^3]: it could also be that I’m shying away from creating the masterpiece *because* it’s a masterpiece. story for another day. i think this is less of a factor to the problem here.
[^4]: consistency is something I’m working on. if not consistency, it’s the resiliency to restart. interestingly, thats consistency in another form. either way, i’ll surely be writing about it soon and the biological and environmental factors that affect my ability to be so.
